Definition: git status

The Git Status command is used in the terminal to see the the status of the project you're working on. For instance, if you made changes to your project, it'll tell you if the changes are tracked or not, if the changes are committed, it'll tell you if you've pushed the commit to the remote repository and so on. 

It is a useful command to use to see if you're all up to date on your project workflow, and if you're not, what needs to be done to be all up to date on your project. 

The equivalent to the Git Status command in Jupyter Lab IDE is to go in the Git extension tab of Jupyter Lab, and to see what is in the changes/conflicts tab where it says what is staged, what is committed, what needs to be pushed or pulled to/from the remote repository and so on.
